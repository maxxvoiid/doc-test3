## Overview

Voiid Countdown Timer is a simple timer plugin for Minecraft servers. Although it is simple, it can be very advanced if you know how to get the most out of it. It is compatible with **Bukkit, Spigot, Paper, and Purpur 1.13\+**. **Paper** is highly recommended due to its great performance and full compatibility.

### Key Features

* Customization of timers (time, text, formats, sounds, and more)
* Events with a simple API, but very powerful with other plugins, such as [ConditionalEvents](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/conditionalevents-custom-actions-for-specific-events-1-8-1-21-8.82271/)
* Support for placeholders via [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/)
* Easy configuration via `config.yml`
