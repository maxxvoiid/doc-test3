## Overview

Voiid Countdown Timer is a simple timer plugin for Minecraft servers. Although it is simple, it can be very advanced if you know how to get the most out of it. It is compatible with **Bukkit, Spigot, Paper, and Purpur 1.13\+**. **Paper** is highly recommended due to its great performance and full compatibility.

### Key Features

- Customization of timers (time, text, formats, sounds, and more)
- Events with a simple API, but very powerful with other plugins, such as [ConditionalEvents](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/conditionalevents-custom-actions-for-specific-events-1-8-1-21-8.82271/)
- Support for placeholders via [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/)
- Easy configuration via `config.yml`

## What is the availability of VCT?

Voiid Countdown Timer has two separate and somewhat different versions:

- **Datapack (V1):** Compatible with Minecraft Vanilla 1.15\+ in single or multiplayer worlds. It could be considered the Lite version of VCT, without as many features as the plugin.
- **Plugin (V2):** Compatible with Bukkit, Spigot, Paper, and Purpur 1.13\+. It can be considered the definitive version of VCT, with features that can be added over time.

Voiid Countdown Timer started out as a datapack, but then evolved into a plugin version. Although the datapack version continues to be updated to work with more versions, the plugin will have features that the datapack will not have.

## Where can VCT be downloaded?

## I would like to try the experimental versions of VCT. Where can I find them?

<Note>
  The experimental versions contain several bugs and features that may be added to VCT releases. Everything shown in the experimental versions is subject to change.
</Note>

Usually, all experimental versions can be downloaded at:

**Github:** https://github.com/Voiid-Studios/voiidcountdown/releases

**Modrinth:** https://modrinth.com/datapack/voiid-countdown-timer

Experimental versions have some identifiable acronyms, such as:

- "v1.4.0\*\*-a1\*\*": Alpha Version _\<number\> -_ These are versions that are in the early stages before going into production, usually for testing purposes.
- "v1.4.0\*\*-b1\*\*": Beta Version _\<number\> -_ These are the versions that are in the intermediate stages before reaching production.
- "v1.4.0\*\*-rc1\*\*": Release Candidate Version _\<number\> -_ These are the versions that are in the final stages before going into production.

<Tip>
  When you try out an experimental version, please send us your feedback. We love hearing your opinion so we can continue to improve\!

## Important Things

- You must have **Minecraft 1.13** or later, as plugin dependencies do not exist or are broken in older versions. If players connect with ViaBackwards, the timer may not display correctly.
- **Craftbukkit is incompatible** with VCT. Please use Spigot, Paper, or Purpur to use VCT in optimal conditions.
- Unexpected bugs may be found in some versions. If this happens, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Voiid-Studios/voiidcountdown/issues) in the Github repository.
