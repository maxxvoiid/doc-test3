This page specifically discusses the options available in the Voiid Countdown Timer `config.yml` file. You can customize how the timer looks, the refresh time, text format, and the messages sent by VCT.

<Expandable title="Default config.yml">
  ```yaml
  Config:
  # The plugin will send an update notification message when it finds an available update.
  update_notification: true
  # When the timer ends, how many ticks should wait to hide the boss bar (1 second = 20 ticks)
  ticks_hide_after_ending: 60
  # Which text formatter to use (MINIMESSAGE, LEGACY or UNIVERSAL)
  # Please note that UNIVERSAL requires the most resources, but supports all types of formats.
  
  # (&x&f&f&5&5&f&fc and &#ff55ff LEGACY - <color:#ff55ff> MINIMESSAGE)
  text_format: LEGACY
  # How many ticks should the boss bar text refresh?
  # It is usually used when you use animations to make them more fluid.
  refresh_ticks: 10
  # Should the plugin save and load the timer states when the server is closed and opened?
  save_state_timers: true

## Configuration Options

Below are the settings and descriptions in the `config.yml` file for Voiid Countdown Timer.

### `update_notification: false`

Usually, every time VCT is launched, it will automatically check for available updates. This setting defines whether the plugin should send a message to the console and players with the `voiidcountdowntimer.admin` permission notifying them of a new version.

### `ticks_hide_after_ending: 60`

This setting defines how many ticks to wait before hiding the timer completely when the timer ends.

### `text_format: LEGACY`

This setting defines which text formatting system to use for name tags. The `LEGACY` format is the text that Minecraft Vanilla understands to use colors, bold, italics, and everything else. Other supported formats include:

- `MINIMESSAGE`: A rich text format with allows you to use rich text formatting features, like colors, gradients, styles, hover events, and click events.
- `UNIVERSAL`: Attempts to support all formatting options but is the most resource-intensive.

Here are some examples of use with the different types of supported formats:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="LEGACY">
    The `LEGACY` format supports the color format with `&`.

    ```yaml
    text: "&eThis is an &aexample &ausing the &l&9LEGACY format. &r&bTime remaining: &l&d%HH%:%MM%:%SS%"
    ```

    ![Legacyexample Gi](/images/configuration/legacyexample.gif)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="MINIMESSAGE">
    The `MINIMESSAGE` format supports its own parameters. You can find more information here: https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/index.html

    ```yaml
    text: "<gradient:#ff08ff:#fef502>This is an <green>example</green> using the <bold>MINIMESSAGE format.</bold></gradient> <rainbow>Time remaining: <bold>%HH%:%MM%:%SS%</bold></rainbow>"
    ```

    ![Minimessageexample Gi](/images/configuration/minimessageexample.gif)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="UNIVERSAL">
    The `UNIVERSAL` format supports both the `LEGACY` and `MINIMESSAGE` formats, but keep in mind that it may consume more resources.

    ```yaml
    text: "<gradient:red:aqua>This is an &aexample &rusing the &lUNIVERSAL format.</gradient> <rainbow>Time remaining: <bold>%HH%:%MM%:%SS%</bold></rainbow>"
    ```

    ![Universalexample Gi](/images/configuration/universalexample.gif)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  If you use the `MINIMESSAGE` format with a gradient, you can improve it even more by making it animated. [You can find more information here.](/usage-guide/animations)
</Tip>

### `refresh_ticks: 10`

This setting determines how many ticks the timer text should refresh. This setting is designed for gradient animations, to make them appear smoother or slower, for example:

![Refreshxample Gi](/images/configuration/refreshexample.gif)

### `save_state_timers: true`

This setting defines whether the plugin should save the timer status when the server is shut down and load it when the server is started up.

It is advisable to leave it set to **true**, because if your server crashes, the plugin will save the status so that you don't lose the time that was set.

## Configuration of Messages

Messages are configured in `LEGACY` format (regardless of the text format chosen), each section has a small identifier indicating where it comes from.

<Warning>
  Adding or removing messages may damage the plugin configuration\!
</Warning>

## Configuration of Timers

The configuration of the timers is quite simple and easy to create. Let's use this example as a basis:

```yaml
Timers:
  green_timer:
    text: "&aI'm a green timer of (%HH%:%MM%:%SS%) :D"
    sound: UI_BUTTON_CLICK
    sound_volume: 0.5
    sound_pitch: 2.0
    bossbar_color: GREEN
    enabled: true
    sound_enabled: true
```

<Info>
  All of these configurations can be changed in-game using the `/vct modify` command and the following modifiers: `text`, `sound`, `sound_volume`, `sound_pitch`, `bossbar_color`, `sound_enabled`
</Info>

### `Timers:`

This is a very important argument when you create timers in a file other than `config.yml` in the **timers folder.** This argument must be present for the timers inside to be registered.

### `green_timer:`

This is the argument that will give the timer its name so that it can be easily identified, for example: “timer_for_pvp_on”.

### `text: "&aI'm a green timer of (%HH%:%MM%:%SS%) :D"`

This is the text that will be displayed in the boss bar. It also includes variables:

- `%HH%` - Displays the current hours (00)
- `%MM%` - Displays the current minutes (00)
- `%SS%` - Displays the current seconds (00)

### `sound: UI_BUTTON_CLICK`

This is the sound that all players will hear as time runs down. You can find a list of sounds here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Sound.html

Additionally, you can use sounds from resource packs that play every second, such as:

```yaml
sound: resourcepackNameHere:soundNameHere
```

<Note>
  The setting `sound_enabled` must be enabled for you to hear the sound.
</Note>

### `sound_volume: 0.5`

This will set the volume at which the sound will be heard, ranging from `0.1` to `2.0`.

### `sound_pitch: 2.0`

This will define the pitch at which the sound will be heard, ranging from `0.1` (very low) to `2.0` (very high).

### `bossbar_color: GREEN`

This is the color of the boss bar that the timer will have when you create it with `/vct set`. You can find a list of colors here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/boss/BarColor.html

### `enabled: true`

Indicate whether the timer can be used and is selectable. If you disable it while using it, it will automatically switch to the default style.

### `sound_enabled: true`

Indicates whether the timer sound should be heard.
