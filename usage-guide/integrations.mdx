The plugin has some integrations to expand its actions. The available integrations are:

## 1. PlaceholderAPI

PlaceholderAPI integration is supported to obtain timer information with placeholders.

| Placeholder                      | Description                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `%vct_timer_hhmmss:<timer_id>%`  | Get the hours, minutes and seconds (00:00:00) of the timer. |
| `%vct_timer_hh:<timer_id>%`      | Get the hours (00) of the timer.                            |
| `%vct_timer_mm:<timer_id>%`      | Get the minutes (00) of the timer.                          |
| `%vct_timer_ss:<timer_id>%`      | Get the seconds (00) of the timer.                          |
| `%vct_timer_active:<timer_id>%`  | Return 'true' or 'false' if the timer is active.            |
| `%vct_timer_running:<timer_id>%` | Return 'true' or 'false' if the timer is running.           |
| `%vct_timer_paused:<timer_id>%`  | Return 'true' or 'false' if the timer is paused.            |

The argument of is the timerid of a specific timer created, for example: `%vct_timer_hhmmss:timer_1%`. Also, if you use it without `:<timer_id>`, it will take the timer that is currently active (global).
