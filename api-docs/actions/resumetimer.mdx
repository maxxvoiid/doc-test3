  - If a player passes, they will receive a message indicating that the timer was modified
    - It is usually not necessary to use it directly in the API
</ResponseField>

  Indicates whether the operation succeeded.

  - `true` — the timer exists and is now resumed.
  - `false` — no active timer exists or the operation failed.
</ResponseField>
