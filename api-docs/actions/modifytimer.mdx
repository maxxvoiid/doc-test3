title: ".modifyTimer()"
description: "Modify an existing timer by adding, taking, or setting a specific amount of time."
---

## Usage Example

```java
//// VCTActions.modifyTimer(modifier, timeHHMMSS, sender?) ////

// Add 5 minutes to the timer
boolean success = VCTActions.modifyTimer("add", "00:05:00");

// Take 2 minutes from the timer
boolean success = VCTActions.modifyTimer("take", "00:02:00");

// Set the timer to 10 minutes exactly
boolean success = VCTActions.modifyTimer("set", "00:10:00");
```

## Behavior

- The method requires that a **timer already exists**.
  - If no active timer is found, the method will fail and return `false`.
- Available actions (`modifier`):
  - `"add"` — increases the current remaining time.
  - `"take"` — decreases the current remaining time (cannot go below `00:00:00`).
  - `"set"` — overrides the timer with the new exact time.
- When modified:
  - The timer’s will automatically refresh to reflect the new value. This does NOT mean deleting and creating a new timer with the same style.
  - The `MODIFY` event is triggered.

## Parameters

<ResponseField name="modifier" type="string" required>
  Action to apply to the timer.

  The available actions are `"add"`, `"take"`, and `"set"`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="timeHHMMSS" type="string" required>
  The time in HH:MM:SS format.

  - Example: “00:05:30” (5 minutes, 30 seconds)
  - If the value is “00:00:00” or does not comply with the format, the modify will fail.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="sender" type="CommandSender">
  Reference to the player who performed the action.

  - If a player passes, they will receive a message indicating that the timer was modified
    - It is usually not necessary to use it directly in the API
</ResponseField>

## Returns

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean">
  Indicates whether the operation succeeded.

  - `true` — a timer exists and the modification was applied successfully.
  - `false` — no active timer exists, or the provided parameters were invalid.
</ResponseField>
