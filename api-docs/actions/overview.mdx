## What are Timer Actions?

Timer Actions are **utility methods** that let you control the lifecycle and state of an already active timer using the integrated API.\
They provide developers and commands with a simple interface to:

- Pause or resume the countdown.
- Modify the remaining time dynamically.
- Stop and destroy the timer when itâ€™s no longer needed.

These methods are usually accessed through `VCTActions` depending on the action.

<Warning>
  Previously, `VCTAPI` was used to execute actions, but it has been **deprecated and will be removed in version 2.1.0**, as it has been renamed to `VCTActions` to better differentiate it.
</Warning>

The VCT API exposes a single main event `VCTEvent`, which is triggered whenever a timer-related action occurs.
This event provides all the information necessary to react appropriately in your plugin.

  </Card>
  <Card title=".pauseTimer()" href="/api-docs/actions/pausetimer">
    Pause the currently active timer
  </Card>
  <Card title=".resumeTimer()" href="/api-docs/actions/resumetimer">
    Resume a previously paused timer
  </Card>
  <Card title=".stopTimer()" href="/api-docs/actions/stoptimer">

  </Card>
</Columns>
<Card title=".modifyTimer()" href="/api-docs/actions/modifytimer">

<Note>
  There are many actions that require an **active timer** to work. If there is no timer when the action is called, it will fail and return `null`/`false`.
