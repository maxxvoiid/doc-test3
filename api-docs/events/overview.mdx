The VCT API exposes a single main event `VCTEvent`, which is triggered whenever a timer-related action occurs.
This event provides all the information necessary to react appropriately in your plugin.

## The event itself
```java
import voiidstudios.vct.api.VCTEvent;

// Event called when a timer action is performed
@EventHandler
public void onVCTEvent(VCTEvent event) {

  Timer timer = event.getTimer(); // Returns null if the timer no longer exists
  CommandSender sender = event.getSender(); // It can be a player, the console, or null if it comes from another source, such as a plugin
  Player player = event.getPlayer(); // Return null if not a player
  String timerId = event.getTimerId();
  String timeInitial = event.getInitialTime();
  String timeLeft = event.getTimeLeft();
  
}
```
