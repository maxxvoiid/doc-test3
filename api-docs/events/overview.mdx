title: "Timer Events Overview"
description: "Information about the main VCT event and how to implement it."
---

The VCT API exposes a single main event `VCTEvent`, which is triggered whenever a timer-related action occurs.
This event provides all the information necessary to react appropriately in your plugin.

## The event itself

```java
import voiidstudios.vct.api.VCTEvent;

// Event called when a timer action is performed
@EventHandler
public void onVCTEvent(VCTEvent event) {

  Timer timer = event.getTimer(); // Returns null if the timer no longer exists
  CommandSender sender = event.getSender(); // It can be a player, the console, or null if it comes from another source, such as a plugin
  Player player = event.getPlayer(); // Return null if not a player
  String timerId = event.getTimerId();
  String timeInitial = event.getInitialTime();
  String timeLeft = event.getTimeLeft();
  
}
```

<Tip>
  There are plugins such as [Conditional Events](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/conditionalevents-custom-actions-for-specific-events-1-8-1-21-8.82271/) that support API listening, and you can use them to create great things!
