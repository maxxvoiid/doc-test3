description: "Triggered when the remaining time of a timer is modified."
---

## Usage Example

```java
@EventHandler
public void onVCTEvent(VCTEvent event) {
    if (event.getType() == VCTEventType.MODIFY) {
        Bukkit.broadcastMessage("Timer " + event.getTimerId() + " was modified! New time: " + event.getTimeLeft());
    }
}
```

## Behavior

* Fired when the timer is modified with `/vct modify` or the API.
* The event provides the **new remaining time** after the modification.

## Parameters

<ResponseField name="event" type="VCTEvent">
  Represents the event. Useful getters:  

* `String getTimerId()` — ID of the modified timer
* `String getTimeLeft()` — the new remaining time in HH:MM:SS

</ResponseField>
