<Info>
  These are only basic examples ‚Äî you can mix and match events to create complex logic such as countdown-based minigames, reward systems, or event triggers.

## Broadcast when a timer starts

```java
@EventHandler
public void onVCTEvent(VCTEvent event) {
    if (event.getType() == VCTEventType.CREATE) {
        Bukkit.broadcastMessage("A new timer has started: " + event.getTimerId() + " (" + event.getInitialTime() + ")");
    }
}
```

- Useful for announcing timers to all players.
- Gives context when a new timer begins.

## Send bossbar updates every second

```java
@EventHandler
public void onVCTEvent(VCTEvent event) {
    if (event.getType() == VCTEventType.CHANGE) {
        String timeLeft = event.getTimeLeft();
        Bukkit.getOnlinePlayers().forEach(player -> {
            player.sendActionBar("‚è≥ Time left: " + timeLeft);
        });
    }
}
```

- Runs every second.
- Good for syncing custom UI or scoreboards with the timer.

## Grant rewards when timer finishes

```java
@EventHandler
public void onVCTEvent(VCTEvent event) {
    if (event.getType() == VCTEventType.FINISH) {
        Bukkit.broadcastMessage("The timer " + event.getTimerId() + " has ended! üéâ");

        // Reward all players
        for (Player player : Bukkit.getOnlinePlayers()) {
            player.giveExpLevels(5);
        }
    }
}
```

- Perfect for minigames or challenges that end with rewards.
- Trigger extra logic when the timer reaches 00:00:00.

## Pause/resume feedback

```java
@EventHandler
public void onVCTEvent(VCTEvent event) {
    switch (event.getType()) {
        case PAUSE:
            Bukkit.broadcastMessage("The timer " + event.getTimerId() + " has been paused ‚è∏Ô∏è");
            break;
        case RESUME:
            Bukkit.broadcastMessage("The timer " + event.getTimerId() + " has resumed ‚ñ∂Ô∏è");
            break;
    }
}
```

- Simple way to keep players informed when the timer state changes.

## Log when a timer is stopped manually

```java
@EventHandler
public void onVCTEvent(VCTEvent event) {
    if (event.getType() == VCTEventType.STOP) {
        Bukkit.getLogger().info("[MyPlugin] Timer stopped: " + event.getTimerId());
    }
}
```

- Useful for debugging or auditing timer interruptions.

## Announce time modifications

```java
@EventHandler
public void onVCTEvent(VCTEvent event) {
    if (event.getType() == VCTEventType.MODIFY) {
        Bukkit.broadcastMessage("Timer " + event.getTimerId() + 
                                " was modified! New time: " + event.getTimeLeft());
    }
}
```

- Lets everyone know when the timer is adjusted.
- Great for competitive scenarios (adding bonus time, penalties, etc.).
