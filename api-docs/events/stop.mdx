## Usage Example

```java
@EventHandler
public void onVCTEvent(VCTEvent event) {
    if (event.getType() == VCTEventType.STOP) {
        Bukkit.broadcastMessage("The timer " + event.getTimerId() + " has been stopped!");
    }
}
```

## Behavior

* Fired when the active timer is stopped and removed manually.
* Does not trigger `FINISH`, since it is considered an interruption.

  Represents the event. Useful getters:  

* `String getTimerId()` â€” ID of the stopped timer

</ResponseField>
